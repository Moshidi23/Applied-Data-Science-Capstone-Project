# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This project was the final part of a 10 course Data Science track by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. It was done as an industry partnership with SwiftKey. The job was to clean and analyze a large corpus of unstructured text and build a word prediction model and use it in a web application.
